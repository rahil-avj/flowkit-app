// ── Flat-mode detection ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Repo mode:  flowkit is running from its own source tree (this platform repo).
// Flat mode:  flowkit is installed as a dependency inside an author's project.
//
// History of this check, because it has broken twice for two different reasons:
//
// 1. Originally keyed off whether CWD has a workspaces/ directory. Wrong — this
//    repo can legitimately have zero workspaces (freshly cloned, between `nw`
//    and the first workspace, or mid single-workspace migration) while still
//    being repo mode. When it misfired, `workspacePath()` fell through to its
//    flat-mode branch (`return process.cwd()`), and `flowkit rw` run from the
//    repo root deleted the entire repo.
// 2. Fixed by keying off `node_modules` appearing in ROOT's path (a structural
//    fact of how flowkit was installed, which can't drift the way a
//    directory's contents can) — but this broke too: `npm install` on a
//    `file:` dependency (exactly what create-flowkit-app's --local-dev escape
//    hatch produces, and what `npm link` produces) creates a SYMLINK, not a
//    copy, under node_modules. `import.meta.url` resolves through that symlink
//    to ROOT's realpath, which has no `node_modules` segment at all — so a
//    flat-mode project using a symlinked flowkit dependency was misdetected as
//    repo mode, pointing every workspace-scoped path at the real monorepo on
//    the developer's machine instead of the flat project. Confirmed live by
//    scaffolding via create-flowkit-app and running `flowkit status` from
//    inside it.
//
// Current approach: a marker file (.flowkit-repo-root) at this repo's actual
// root, tracked in git, deliberately excluded from package.json's "files"
// allowlist so it never ships to any real install — npm registry, git dep, or
// `file:` dep, symlinked or copied. Its presence is the one signal that
// distinguishes "the real monorepo checkout" from any way flowkit can be
// consumed as a dependency, and its absence fails toward the SAFE direction
// (repo-only commands get wrongly blocked, not wrongly allowed against the
// wrong ROOT).
