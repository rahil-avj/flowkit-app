# FlowLens

FlowLens covers two tightly related subsystems: **FlowTracer** (the recorder, always available) and **FlowLens mode** (the replay and analytics surface, build-gated). Together they close the feedback loop: prototype → record → analyze → iterate.

---

## Scope

### In scope

#### FlowTracer (recording — always on)

- `SessionRecorderProvider` — state machine: `idle → recording ⇄ paused → idle`
- Records: `SessionEvent` (taps, navigations, state changes), `CursorSample` (throttled 50ms, stored as % of container), `SessionMeta`, `SessionSnapshot`
- **13 toggleable channels:** interactions, navigation, effects, stateChanges, simulatorChanges, panelActivity, sidebarActivity, cursorTracking, frustratedClicks, hoverEvents (+ 3 always-on)
- **WriteBatcher(300ms)** — queues writes; single IndexedDB transaction per store per 300ms; reduces overhead from ~60/s to ~2/s
- Quality scoring: `computeQuality()` — flow-entry (+40), ≥3 screens (+30), ≥30s (+30); sessions below threshold auto-deleted
- Auto-pruning: `SessionDb.pruneOldSessions(200)` — fires after every `startRecording`
- Crash recovery: detects incomplete sessions on mount; recomputes meta from persisted events
- Inactivity auto-stop: 5 min idle finalizes with quality gate
- Gated by `flowkit:sessions:enabled` localStorage toggle (independent of FlowLens build flag)

#### Session export/import

- Single session: `SessionExport` object, `.flowkit-session.json`
- Bundle: `SessionExport[]` array, `.bundle.flowkit-session.json`; import auto-detects array vs object
- Session merge: `handleMerge` re-sequences all events/snapshots/cursor samples with single monotonic counter

#### FlowLens mode (replay + analytics — build-gated)

- Gated: presence-based — available whenever `src/modes/flowlens/index.ts` exists on disk, in both dev and standalone builds. `VITE_ENABLE_FLOWLENS` does not gate this (superseded by the presence-based mechanism; see the 2026-07-10 correction entry below — dead env var removed).
- Lazy-loaded chunk — zero bytes in standalone when the folder is absent (Rollup DCE via `import.meta.glob`)
- Toggle: canvas toolbar ScanEye button, Action Center, per-session card "Replay in FlowLens"
- `FlowLensModeContext` sits above `DashboardProvider` so `replayActive` is readable by the dashboard

#### Replay engine

- `replayFromSnapshot(session, seq)` — folds events ≤ seq into full dashboard state
- `ReplayController` pushes state into shared `DashboardContext` via imperative setters, guarded by `replayActive` — replayed setters never re-record
- Cross-workspace guard: sessions whose screen ids don't intersect current workspace views disable replay (analytics still available)
- Snapshot/restore: pre-replay db/device/orientation/accessibility snapshotted at mount, restored on unmount

#### Single-session analytics

- Metrics, Paths, Funnel, Heatmap — via `AnalyticsOverlay`
- Heatmap: real recorded screen behind cursor density; independent Screen/Heatmap toggles + legend

#### Multi-session Reports (Phase 3 — active)

- `ReportsOverlay.tsx` revamp: two-pane layout (collapsible filter sidebar + tabbed main)
- Tabs: Overview, Funnel, Heatmap, Sessions
- All filters exposed: screen, device, connection, quality range, tags, date range, outcome, source
- Sortable sessions table
- Loading skeletons and empty states
- `reports/aggregate.ts`, `reports/sessionFilters.ts` — aggregation and filter logic (unchanged by revamp)

#### Committed session library

- `src/modes/flowlens/library/<workspace>/*.json` — hand-managed, committed to git
- Glob-loaded inside the lazy chunk — zero cost when FlowLens is off
- Library wins de-dupe on id when merged with recorded IndexedDB sessions
- CLI-managed: `sessions:import`, `sessions:ls`, `sessions:check`, `sessions:rm`, `sessions:brief`

#### `sessions:brief` (CLI)

- Reads committed library; aggregates dwell time, frustrated clicks, drop-off data
- `--append` writes to `.agent/project.md` for agent consumption

### Out of scope

- Influencing flow execution — FlowTracer/FlowLens are pure observers (Principle 11: Observers Never Influence Execution)
- Replacing `IndexedDB` with a server-side store — the recording engine is browser-only by design
- Real-time multi-user session streaming
- A/B testing infrastructure
- A/B variant assignment or cohort management
- Video screen recording (cursor + events only; no pixel capture)
- Exporting analytics to third-party platforms (Amplitude, Mixpanel, etc.)

### Key constraints

- **Build gate is enforced via `import.meta.env`** — not a runtime check. Vite inlines the value; Rollup DCEs the import. Never reference the env flag in a runtime conditional that could survive tree-shaking.
- **Recording is workspace-scoped.** `SessionRecorderProvider` receives `workspaceId`; all sessions are tagged to it. Cross-workspace replay is blocked.
- **`WriteBatcher` is module-level singleton.** Never write events directly to IndexedDB — go through `sessionWriteBatcher` in `sessionDb.ts`.
- **Observers never re-record.** All imperative setters called during replay are guarded by `replayActive` flag. This preserves determinism.

## Decision Log

Append-only. Most recent at top.

## 2026-06-26 — Multi-session Reports revamp scoped to `ReportsOverlay.tsx` only

**Decision:** The revamp changes only `src/modes/flowlens/components/reports/ReportsOverlay.tsx`. No changes to `AnalyticsOverlay.tsx`, `analyticsPrimitives.tsx`, `aggregate.ts`, `sessionFilters.ts`, or `HeatmapView.tsx`.
**Reason:** Containment. The layout problem (flat filter bar, no tabs, no sessions list) is a UI-only issue. The aggregation and filter logic in `aggregate.ts` and `sessionFilters.ts` is correct — the data model already supports date ranges and quality range filters that the old UI just didn't expose.
**Source:** `Documentation/project-plans/specs/flowlens-reports-overlay.md`

---

## 2026-06-26 — Multi-session Reports scoped to Phase 3

**Decision:** Multi-session analytics (`ReportsOverlay`) is Phase 3 work. Phase 1 was single-session replay + analytics. Phase 2 is the visual flow editor.
**Reason:** Multi-session aggregation requires cohort filtering, merged heatmaps, and session list infrastructure that adds scope beyond the core replay mission. Shipping Phase 1 (replay) independently validated the recording pipeline before building on top of it.
**Source:** Comment in `src/modes/flowlens/components/FlowLensAnalyticsOverlays.tsx`: "Multi-session Reports land in Phase 3."

---

## 2026-06-26 — `LensSideExplorer` / `LensSideInspector` are the FlowLens panel component names

**Decision:** The left panel component is `LensSideExplorer.tsx` (sessions list) and the right panel is `LensSideInspector.tsx` (tabbed session info / reports quick view). Earlier doc referred to non-existent `FlowLensLeftPanel.tsx` and `FlowLensRailPanel.tsx`.
**Reason:** Named to match the `KitSideExplorer` / `KitSideInspector` conventions in the main canvas — FlowLens reuses the same structural pattern with its own content.
**Source:** `ls src/modes/flowlens/components/`; doc audit correction

---

## 2026-06-26 — Session library committed to `src/modes/flowlens/library/<ws>/`

**Decision:** Committed sessions live inside the lazy FlowLens chunk at `src/modes/flowlens/library/<workspace>/*.json`. They are glob-loaded and thus cost nothing when `VITE_ENABLE_FLOWLENS` is off.
**Reason:** Co-locating with the chunk means the glob is only evaluated when the chunk is loaded. Placing library files outside the chunk would require a separate glob that could not be dead-code-eliminated.

---

## 2026-06-26 — FlowTracer gated by localStorage toggle, independent of build flag

**Decision:** Recording is always available in the bundle regardless of `VITE_ENABLE_FLOWLENS`. Whether recording is active in-session is controlled by `flowkit:sessions:enabled` localStorage toggle.
**Reason:** Separating the build gate (FlowLens replay) from the runtime gate (recording) lets teams ship the standalone export with recording on but replay off — sessions accumulate in IndexedDB and can be extracted for later analysis without the full FlowLens analytics UI in the build.

---

## 2026-06-26 — `WriteBatcher(300ms)` as module-level singleton

**Decision:** Events and cursor samples are queued through `sessionWriteBatcher` — a module-level `WriteBatcher(300)` in `sessionDb.ts` — not written directly to IndexedDB.
**Reason:** At 60fps cursor tracking, individual writes would produce ~60 IndexedDB transactions/sec. The batcher reduces this to ~2/sec with no data loss — `stopRecording` calls `await sessionWriteBatcher.flush()` before reading counts.

## 2026-07-10 — Correction: `VITE_ENABLE_FLOWLENS` was a dead env var, removed

**Finding:** Despite this doc's earlier entries describing `VITE_ENABLE_FLOWLENS` as the standalone-build gate, it was never actually read anywhere in the app/build logic — confirmed via exhaustive grep across `src/`, `scripts/`, and all three vite configs. The real gate has always been the presence-based `import.meta.glob` check in `FlowLensModeContext.tsx` (that file's own code comment states "No env flag needed"). `scripts/builders/export.js` set the env var on the child build process, but `vite.config.standalone.ts` never read it and never touched `src/modes/flowlens/`, so `flowkit export` and `export:full` produced identical output regardless of the flag — a real functional bug, not just a doc inaccuracy.
**Fix:** Removed `VITE_ENABLE_FLOWLENS` entirely — the dead export.js env-var pass-through, the `ManageContent.tsx` "Enable FlowLens mode" UI button (which also mislabeled itself as controlling session _recording_, which is separately gated by the `flowkit:sessions:enabled` localStorage toggle per the entry above), the now-unused `generateEnvFlagPatch` generator, and stale comments/docs referencing it (`vite.config.ts`, `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `docs/FLOWLENS.md`, `docs/FLOWLENS-GUIDE.md`, `Documentation/README.md`, `Documentation/product/vision/FEATURES.md`, `Documentation/product/features-by-persona.md`). `scripts/builders/export.js`'s `buildStandalone()` now actually implements the presence-based gate directly — renames `src/modes/flowlens/` out of the way for a plain `export`, restores it in a `finally` block — so `export` vs. `export:full` now genuinely differ in output, which they previously did not.
