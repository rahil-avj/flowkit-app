# FlowKit — Vision & North Star

## What FlowKit is

FlowKit is a **browser-based execution platform for interactive UI prototypes**. Screens are React components. Flows are ordered sequences of screens. The platform executes them — with real conditional logic, a live mock database, device simulation, and session recording — so prototypes behave like real products rather than static click-throughs.

**Who it's for:** Designers and developers building multi-screen product flows who need more than a slide deck but less than a production app. Primary use case: validate interactions and user journeys before writing production code.

**Fidelity range:** Quick wireframes → polished high-fidelity mockups → production-ready component previews. Same platform, same flows, same recording infrastructure at any fidelity.

## What a successful v1 looks like

Seven core features, fully working, correctly gated:

| Feature           | What it does                                                                      |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **FlowMaster**    | Executes flows — interactions, guards, animations, flowplan journeys              |
| **FlowTracer**    | Records every session automatically (taps, navigations, state, cursor)            |
| **FlowLens**      | Replays recordings in the live canvas; single-session and multi-session analytics |
| **Feedback**      | In-canvas per-screen comment wall with cloud sync and export                      |
| **Flow Debugger** | Live runtime inspection: interaction log, db state, navigation history            |
| **Flow Library**  | Browse and run flowplans; workspace hierarchy tree                                |
| **Simulator**     | Device presets, connection mode, accessibility filters, custom workspace controls |

A feature management system (registry → entitlement resolver → feature gate) gates these at build and runtime. See `Documentation/project-plans/Feature_Management_System.md`.

## What FlowKit is NOT

Guard rails — these are explicitly out of scope:

- **Not a component library.** The kit system (`src/kits/`) exists to serve workspace authors, not to be distributed as a standalone UI kit.
- **Not a design tool.** FlowKit has no drawing, layout, or visual editing surface. Screens are code.
- **Not a testing framework.** FlowLens analytics inform decisions; they don't assert correctness or replace automated tests.
- **Not a production host.** The standalone export (`flowkit export`) is for sharing previews, not running in production.
- **Not a CMS or feature-flag service.** The feature registry is a dev-edited config file, not a runtime dashboard or LaunchDarkly replacement.
- **Not a backend.** The mock database is an in-memory prototype tool. There is no persistence, auth, or API layer.

## The five values that guide every decision

From `Documentation/DevelopmentValues.md` — the five highest-leverage:

1. **Single ownership.** Every piece of state has exactly one owner. When ownership is unclear, fix the architecture — don't work around it.
2. **Runtime independence.** The execution engine never depends on how a flow was authored. New authoring formats get new compilers, not runtime changes.
3. **Observers never influence execution.** Recording, analytics, and debugging are read-only. They receive information; they never change what happens.
4. **Layer boundaries are hard.** `Authoring → Compiler → Runtime → Coordination → UI → Observers`. Cross-layer shortcuts need strong justification every time.
5. **Incremental evolution.** The smallest correct improvement, backed by evidence. Speculation is not justification. Large rewrites are risks, not solutions.
